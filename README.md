# Peer-graded assignment: Getting and cleaning data course project

A project to demonstrate student ability to prepare a tidy data set.

# Instructions to complete the assignmet:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each      subject.

# What we have in this repository 

- In "table.txt" we have the required tidy data set.

- In "run_analysis.R" there is the script I realized for performing the analysis

- In "CodeBook.md" you can find the description of the variables, the data, and the transformations I performed to clean up the data.
